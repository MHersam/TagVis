I use the ""cited by"" feature on Google Scholar a lot but it is based on explicit citations - not on whether two papers are related in terms of content/theme/scope. With my current approach I potentially miss a whole bunch of closely related/relevant papers.

Another time saver would be to be able to ""follow"" / see the search results/papers of people who have done a similar search in the past. That is, to benefit from what other people have labelled as ""relevant"" or ""important""","Mainly from the abstract but also by looking at/skimming parts of the content, e.g. a method overview figure if available","No","Yes","No","No","No","","No","No","No","Yes","No","","","","not at all","group papers by general topic and submission, maybe also keywords - the less I have to provide here manually the better, i.e. ideally a system would classify a document and suggest which group/category to put in","","The graph interaction could be smoother. The details of a particular paper stay open even if I interact with the graph (change parameters for example) - this should probably auto-close for certain graph actions. overall good experience!","What is not quite clear to me - if I add a new paper, does it already automatically associate it to existing papers in the library or is it entirely based on the tags I provide? I would love to use a tool like this if these kind of things were automated, i.e. if I didn't have to manually tag all of my papers. Papers these days do provide keywords, ACM CCS classes, IEEE also has a clasification system (although the ACM/IEEE ones are less useful to my experience because they are often not a great fit. Author provided keywords are usually better). Or directly extract this from the paper text/PDF. Also, if a PDF would automatically be found/downloaded for papers and added to the library - this typically takes time to find on GoogleScholar etc. and would be a time saver","see above. In addition, it would be great if instead of authors the title of a paper could be shown in the graph. or in addition venue, e.g. CVPR'21","","","","","","No","Yes","No","No","",""

In the current form it does not really allow for proper exploration of the graph. Ideally the library entry would be shown on click on the node. The scaling factors for the tags do not seem to have much impact and their use is rather unintuitive. The whole tool is only geared towards my own library, but I only put stuff in there I already know and the only time I need to relate my already added papers is for writing. During writing I need access to the abstract, content and even citations.

Selecting all papers in the library requires setting the table to ""show all"" or traverse the pages. The button to visualize is at the bottom of the table, so I always have to scroll around.

When I am in a session, can I change the papers without creating a new session? I feel like the point of a session instead of just tagging a certain subset of papers is that the settings in the graph are retained, so I would like to add papers to the same set of graphs. ","The whole exploration workflow is much better in connected papers, adding and analyzing my own library is also possible in Paperscape. The advantage of connecting your own library and filtering by tags is only really useful to me as an addition to this. Connected Papers and Paperscpae also each have a nice way of presenting the temporal order of papers, which is useful for writing related work sections and discovering the structure of the literature.","The workflow is quite a bit slower than in connected papers due to the separation into different views and the necessity to go back to the library to add another paper. The different graphing methods (tag, citation, correlation) could be pre-loaded and locally cached while viewing the graph. ","Make it one interface where I can simultaneously add papers, view them, add tags etc. --> essentially use the connected papers interface plus your additional features.","Not really, especially when I hover over a node, I would like all nodes to be fixed so that I can drag one note around to better see the connections.

They're renamed to LastnameYear using a Zotero plugin. So I have a large folder called ""Literature"" that has all the papers, and they're linked from Zotero. I search through Zotero to find an appropriate paper to read; I tag them there with ""toread"", ""read"", ""useful"" or with the name of a conference submission I'm working on. ","I'm not a fan of Zotero's interface and the fact that it's not accessible offline on my tablet. ","","It looks really nice!","I would try it, but I'm not sure if I would use it in the long term. I use the shortcuts to add papers to my library a lot, and adding papers to TagVis seems to be more complicated. However, maybe taking more time to add new papers would ensure that I add them correctly, and take less cleanup time later...","Shortcut tool to add paper to the library (while browsing, etc.). Could be a bookmarklet.
While in visualisation mode, clicking on a paper doesn't show you the paper title and info, so for me that's not so helpful if you have 2000+ papers and don't remember which Smith et al. is in the graph...","To me it looked quite intuitive, good job!","","Yes it looks quick and was fun to use.

","No","Yes","No","Yes","","I'm not sure I would use this tool personally because of the issues I mentioned, but I think it would be really cool to run it on our website so that people can interact with OUR papers and see how they related to each other and to some other main papers in the literature.
